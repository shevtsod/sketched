A web game about drawing things from memory!

## Getting Started

Run the app locally using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and access it at <http://localhost:5173>.

```shell
docker compose up
```

> [!CAUTION]
>
> The app should **NOT** be run in production with the default settings! It uses
> unsafe default values for secrets such as `DB_PASSWORD="change-me"` by default
> so that it can be run locally with one command for demo purposes.
> See [`.env.example`](./.example.env) to learn more.
